I interpret user needs by communicating clearly with stakeholders and making sure I fully understand what they want before starting the work. In the SNHU 
Travel project, for example, we gathered requirements such as needing a way to view the top vacation packages and an easy way to search for trip options. 
I translated those into detailed user stories that helped break the work into smaller, manageable tasks. Creating user stories helped because it kept the 
focus on the user experience instead of just building random features.
When approaching the development of programs, I like to start by understanding the problem inside and out, then build small pieces of working software through 
short cycles. In SNHU Travel, we used sprints to roll out features like the "Top 10 Trips" page one at a time, which made it easier to test and adjust based on 
feedback. In the future, I want to continue using Agile processes like sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and sprint retrospectives because they help the team stay 
organized, catch problems early, and make adjustments quickly when things change.
Being a good team member in software development requires communicating openly, supporting your teammates, giving honest but respectful feedback, and following 
through on your work. During the SNHU Travel project, we shared updates in daily stand-ups, helped each other with blockers, and provided input on user stories 
to ensure we were all heading in the right direction. Good teamwork made a huge difference, especially when priorities shifted or features needed to be adjusted 
quickly in response to stakeholder feedback.
